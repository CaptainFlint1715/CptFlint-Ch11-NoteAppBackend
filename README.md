# Cpt.Flint-Ch11-NotesApp

## Description

This project was designed to augment starter code for a Note Taker app with back-end route functionality to enable the saving and displaying of new note entries. This was accomplished through Express.js and the storing and retrieving of data from a JSON file. In working to build out this app, I was able to practice the connecting of front-end and back-end elements and gained insight into the proper utilization of route paths.
